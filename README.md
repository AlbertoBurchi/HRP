# HRP (Hierarchical Risk Parity)

In this repository I collected and slightly changed the code from Professor Prado papers to show the idea of hierarchical risk-parity and forward-looking correlation matrices implied by economic theory

based on Marcos Lopez de Prado papers:
* [Estimation of Theory-Implied Correlation Matrices](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3484152)
* [Building Diversified Portfolios that Outperform Out-of-Sample](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2708678)
* [A Robust Estimator of the Efficient Frontier](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3469961)
